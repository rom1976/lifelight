	 <h3>Vision</h3>
	<p>A young boy was always intrigued by radio that could reach out to a very large listener base. Years ago, he watched people eagerly tuning into their radio programmes every day to listen to the live messages that played on air. As he grew, he noticed the viewership that the television garnered. The power of the media impressed upon his young tender mind. He observed how the media always held a strong appeal with its target audience. As a budding youngster, he was fascinated by picking up new skills on the use of technology in media. He worked closely on the media team in his local church and witnessed how media could positively impact, influence and inspire lives far and near. The idea was born in him! It was not soon before time unfolded his growing desire to use technology to reach the unreached.
	</p>
<p>
That is the story of how it all began for Pr. Roy Mathew. He chose the name “Lifelight to steward the ministry that God had called him for. The name “Lifelight” was derived from the Scriptural guidance that he received through these verses.
</p>
<p>
John 1: 4 – In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind.
</p>
<p>
John 8: 12 – When Jesus spoke again to the people, he said, “I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.”
<p>
Lifelight is not just a name but the ministry endeavours to lend life and light that is eternal and abundant to all its beneficiaries. We aim for lives to be rebuilt – never again to walk in darkness but celebrate the goodness of God through the light of His life.
    </p>      
  <p>And so, Pr. Roy Mathew recognized God’s calling in his life to touch several lives and draw them unto Christ through the reach of media. Prayerfully and purposefully, the radio programming service as a mobile app was soon launched that played back to back handpicked, selective and quality-oriented content ranging from powerful messages, anointed sermons, touching songs to inspiring testimonies. This was only the first step and Pr. Roy Mathew knew he had miles to go!

The Radio service was the first step of Lifelight Ministries to reach the unreached and seek the unchurched. Slowly but steadily, the Ministry enlarged its boundaries of reach – the cords of the tent was lengthened and the stakes were strengthened. Lifelight Ministries extended itself to radio broadcasting in Hindi, Medic Ministries, Youth Camps and Mission trips.

Through these different areas of ministry, we envision lives that will be miraculously transformed and reformed. Broken lives should be build, healed and restored. People should dive into a deeper and a more intimate relationship with God. Lives should be encouraged and equipped to bear much fruit for the extension of His Kingdom. At a time when the use of technology is misused, mismanaged and manipulated for wrong motives, the power media should be leveraged to procure its rightful advantages.

We envision these short forays would expand into larger media and ministerial plans in the time to come!
